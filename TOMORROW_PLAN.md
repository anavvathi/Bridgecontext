## Red Flags (When to Pivot)

If after 2 weeks you see:
- ❌ Less than 50 installs → Your messaging is wrong
- ❌ Zero Pro sign-ups → Pricing is wrong or features aren't compelling
- ❌ No Reddit engagement → Wrong subreddits or bad timing
- ❌ High uninstall rate → Product has bugs or doesn't deliver value

**What to do**: Post in r/SideProject asking for honest feedback. Iterate quickly.

## Green Flags (When to Double Down)

If after 2 weeks you see:
- ✅ 100+ installs → Your messaging resonates
- ✅ 5+ Pro sign-ups → Pricing is validated
- ✅ High Reddit engagement → You're in the right communities
- ✅ Positive reviews → Product delivers value

**What to do**: 
1. Post more frequently
2. Increase ad spend (if budget allows)
3. Reach out to influencers
4. Build requested features faster

## The Brutal Truth Checklist

Before you start, answer these honestly:

- [ ] Am I willing to post on Reddit every week for 3 months?
- [ ] Am I comfortable charging for my work?
- [ ] Can I handle negative feedback without giving up?
- [ ] Will I ship features even if they're not perfect?
- [ ] Am I ready to market as much as I code?

If you answered "no" to any of these, **this plan won't work**.

Marketing is 50% of the job. Coding is the other 50%.

## Final Pep Talk

You've already done the hard part: **you built something people need**.

Now you just need to:
1. Tell people it exists
2. Make it easy to pay you
3. Keep improving based on feedback

That's it. No magic. No hacks. Just consistent execution.

**You're 24 hours away from your first Reddit post.**
**You're 2 weeks away from your first paying customer.**
**You're 6 weeks away from $1k MRR.**

The question is: **Will you actually do it?**

Or will you keep searching for "the perfect idea"?

The choice is yours. 🚀
