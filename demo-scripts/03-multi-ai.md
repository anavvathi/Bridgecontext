**Tweet 1** (Hook):
```
ChatGPT is great at coding.
Claude is great at writing.
Gemini is great at research.

But they don't talk to each other.

Here's how I bridge context between all three in 10 seconds:

🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2** (Problem):
```
The old way:

1. Have conversation in ChatGPT
2. Switch to Claude
3. Re-type everything
4. Lose momentum
5. Waste 5 minutes

Every. Single. Time.

There's a better way...
```

**Tweet 3** (Solution):
```
I built BridgeContext - a Chrome extension that:

✅ Captures full AI conversations
✅ Shuttles between platforms
✅ Injects context with 1 click
✅ 100% local (no cloud)

Watch it in action:

```

**Tweet 4** (Use Case):
```
My workflow:

1. Research in Gemini
2. Bridge → ChatGPT for code
3. Bridge → Claude for docs

All my context travels with me.

No re-explaining.
No copy-paste.
No friction.
```
