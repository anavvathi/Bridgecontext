# BridgeContext for VS Code 🌉

**The Seamless Bridge between AI Research and Local Development.**

BridgeContext for VS Code is the official companion to the BridgeContext Chrome Extension. It allows you to pipe your AI conversations, context history, and expert personas directly into your editor with zero copy-pasting.

## 🚀 How it Works
1.  **Capture**: Use the BridgeContext browser extension to capture a thread from ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.
2.  **Sync**: Click **💻 Sync** in the browser popup.
3.  **Code**: Your context appears instantly in the BridgeContext sidebar in VS Code.

## 🔒 Privacy First
*   **Local-Only**: Data is transferred through a secure OS-level Native Messaging Bridge.
*   **Zero Network Ports**: Unlike other extensions, we don't open open ports or run local web servers.
*   **Encrypted Traffic**: Communication is handled by the OS-trusted messaging channel.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To use this extension, you must have:
1.  The [BridgeContext Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bridgecontext/kgfdnbpnjilbclbobhcmnbbkfenlfafh) installed.
2.  The [Native Messaging Host](https://github.com/anavvathi/Bridgecontext#ide-integration-vs-code) registered on your machine.

## ✨ Features
- **Instant WebView**: View your bridged context in a dedicated sidebar.
- **Copy-to-Editor**: Quickly pull snippets from your research into your active file.
- **Auto-Refresh**: Live updates as you shuttle context from your browser.
