# Privacy Policy for BridgeContext

Last Updated: February 2, 2026

## 1. Overview
BridgeContext ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

## 2. Data Collection
**BridgeContext does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to remote servers.** 
- All conversational context, chat history, and "Context Packs" are stored **locally** on your device using the `chrome.storage.local` API.
- We do not have access to your private conversations or instructions.

## 3. Data Usage
The extension only uses the data you explicitly "capture" to provide "injection" functionality on other AI platforms (as per the "Bridge" workflow). This data never leaves your browser.

## 4. Third-Party Services
While BridgeContext facilitates interaction with third-party AI platforms (like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), we do not share any data with them beyond what you choose to paste/inject into their respective chat interfaces. Your use of those platforms is governed by their own privacy policies.

## 5. Security
Because your data is stored locally, its security depends on your device's security. We use standard browser APIs to ensure data is isolated within the extension's sandbox.

## 6. Contact
If you have any questions, please contact the developer through the GitHub repository: https://github.com/anavvathi/Bridgecontext
