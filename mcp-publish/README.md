# BridgeContext MCP Server

This is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for BridgeContext. It allows AI models (like those in Antigravity IDE, Cursor, or Claude Desktop) to access context bridged from your browser.

## Installation

### Method A: One-Click (Recommended)
Most users should use the [BridgeContext Suite](https://github.com/anavvathi/Bridgecontext/releases) for a complete setup.

### Method B: NPX (Fast)
If you already have BridgeContext installed, you can start the server instantly:
```bash
npx bridge-context
```

## How it works
The server looks for the `exchange.json` file generated by the BridgeContext Chrome extension and Native Host. It uses the Windows Registry (on Windows) to find your installation path automatically.

## Requirements
- BridgeContext Chrome Extension
- BridgeContext Native Host (registered on your system)
