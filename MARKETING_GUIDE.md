**Title**: "I built a Chrome extension that saves ChatGPT conversations and pipes them directly into VS Code. Free to try. Looking for honest feedback."

**Post Body**:
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I'm a developer who got tired of losing context when switching between ChatGPT, Claude, and my code editor. So I built **BridgeContext** - a Chrome extension that:

✅ Captures full AI conversations with one click
✅ Injects context into other AI platforms (no copy-paste)
✅ Pipes directly into VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, Neovim
✅ 100% local-first (your data never leaves your machine)
✅ Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok

[30-second demo video]

**Why I built this:**
I'm a "model polyglot" - I use ChatGPT for coding, Claude for writing, and Gemini for research. Moving my "brain" between them was painful. BridgeContext removes that friction.

**What I need from you:**
- Does this solve a problem you have?
- What features are missing?
- Would you actually use this?

GitHub (open source): [link]

Happy to answer any questions! 🚀

**Expected Results**: 500-1,000 installs, 50-100 comments

Claude users! 🎉

I built a tool that lets you seamlessly move conversations between Claude and other AI platforms.

**Use case:**
1. Start a conversation in ChatGPT
2. Click "Shuttle to Claude" 
3. Your entire context appears in Claude's input box
4. Continue the conversation without losing context

Also works in reverse (Claude → ChatGPT/Gemini) and pipes into VS Code.

[Demo video showing Claude integration]

**Features:**
- One-click context capture
- Direct injection (no copy-paste)
- 100% local privacy
- Free and open source

Looking for feedback from Claude power users!

**Expected Results**: 200-400 installs

**Title**: "Stop copy-pasting between ChatGPT and VS Code"

**Post Body**:
```
Fellow developers! 🧑‍💻

I built a Chrome extension that eliminates the copy-paste dance between ChatGPT and your IDE.

**The old way:**
1. Ask ChatGPT for code
2. Copy response
3. Paste into VS Code
4. Realize you need more context
5. Copy code back to ChatGPT
6. Repeat 10x per day

**The new way:**
1. Ask ChatGPT for code
2. Press Alt+Shift+I
3. Code appears in VS Code sidebar
4. Done

[Demo video: ChatGPT → VS Code in 10 seconds]

**Supports:**
- VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, Neovim
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek
- Bidirectional context flow
- 100% local (no cloud)

Chrome Web Store: [link]
GitHub: [link]

What features would make this a must-have for you?

**Expected Results**: 300-500 installs

**Post for "Share Your Project Saturday" Thread**:
```
**BridgeContext** - Universal AI Memory Proxy

🔗 Link: [Chrome Web Store]
📹 Demo: [30-second video]

**What it does:**
Bridges context between AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and IDEs (VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains).

**The problem:**
AI power users juggle multiple platforms. Moving context between them is manual and high-friction.

**The solution:**
One-click capture, instant injection, 100% local privacy.

**Tech stack:**
- Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- Native Messaging for IDE integration
- Local-first architecture (no backend)

**Status:**
- v1.4.2 live on Chrome Web Store
- 100% free and open source
- Looking for early adopters and feedback

**What I learned:**
Building for privacy-conscious users means saying NO to cloud features that would make monetization easier. Worth it.

Feedback welcome! 🚀
```

**Expected Results**: 100-200 installs per week

### Post 2: "The Problem With AI Memory"

**Outline**:
```
## Current State of AI Memory
- ChatGPT's memory is limited
- Claude forgets between sessions
- Gemini has no persistence

## Why This Matters
- Re-explaining context wastes time
- Can't build on previous conversations
- Knowledge silos across platforms

## Existing Solutions
- Manual copy-paste (painful)
- Screenshot everything (unsearchable)
- Cloud note-taking (privacy concerns)

## A Better Approach
- Local-first memory layer
- Cross-platform context bridge
- User-controlled persistence

## Introducing BridgeContext
[Product description]

## The Future
- AI memory should be user-owned
- Portable across platforms
- Private by default
